These steps are very important.
1. On the data filtering code the filtered data will be outputed to a CSV. 
2. Make two CSV's one for the VBM and one for the CBM.
3. Compile the data into one folder with other data needed to calculate the relaxation time.
4. Please note that other data needed such as total energy caused by strain, shift in band edges due to strain and so on should be compiled alone and you can use simple bash scripts if you use linux so I will not provide those codes.
